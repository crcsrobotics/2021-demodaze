# BEST Robotics 2021 Code - Demo Daze
Robot code and other tools created for the 2021 BEST Robotics competition "Demo Daze"

⚠️ Code is not well documented. ⚠️

## Files

#### main.c

The main robot code. Includes code for recording and playing back autonomous task input recordings. Behavior can be changed by modifying `debugMode` variable.

(Recording output can be found in RobotC under `Robot > Debugger Windows > Debug Stream`. If you don't see this option, check that the menu level is set to Super User under `Window > Menu Level`.)

#### process recording.py

The program that converts the recording output into usable robot code. Code is output to `output.txt`. Usage is explained on run.

## Areas To Improve
- Inadequate documentation, although some exists.
- Some code could be simplified with loops.
